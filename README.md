# Lily58 ZMK Config
## Features
- Homerow mods using [urob's timeless homerow mod feature](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config?tab=readme-ov-file#timeless-homerow-mods)
- Symbol layer based on [gertreuer's symbol layer](https://github.com/getreuer/qmk-keymap?tab=readme-ov-file#my-keymap)
- Tri-state window swapper (requires [PR #1366](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/1366))
- Commonly used symbols in combos on the base layer
  - _These symbols are specific to my development workflow (C#/.NET, React, Typescript). While the symbol layer design is good, I found that switching back and forth to this layer while coding was awkward for me. Having my most used symbols on the base layer is much smoother, and I've tuned the combo timing so that misfires are not an issue._
- Numpad on the nav layer for vim line motions (e.g. `15â†‘` to jump up 15 lines)
- Sticky shift > caps word > caps lock mod morph
- Convenience macros
  - `"ion"` - Chording the `i`, `o`, and `n` keys at the same time outputs the common, but (for me) tricky outward roll of "ion".
  - Cut, Copy, Paste, Select all - All are left-hand only for easy editing while using the mouse.
  - `=>` or "fat arrow" - Used all the time in React/TypeScript, this macro outputs `=>` in a single keystroke, which I use as a combo on the base layer.
- One tap-dance: `&td_winlock`
  - double tap: win lock (`GUI(L)`)
  - triple tap: ctrl+alt+del (triggers login prompt on my PC)
